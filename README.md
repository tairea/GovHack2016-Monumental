Project for GovHack 2016 - Whanganui, New Zealand

Working files in 'gh-pages' branch

By Brett, Trish, James, Ian.

The web application is very inturitive, when opened it should find the area your in and present you with a map with pins in it of local monuments. When these pins are clicked, the show infomation about the monument.

The monumental project is a web app to help people find out infomation about memorials in their area.

The idea was to let the users to find out more infomation about the memorial and to explore the people listed on them to find out who they where.

So rather than a name they have a presence, making it possible to rember them as people by letting the users know things like there age and their service records, where they served and what medials or awards they recieved and who they where with.

We managed to make a web application that people can use to find the memorials in NZ from the NZ Histories memorial register  and to see what data NZ history had collected.

We had hoped to access mil.nz archives to find these peoples service records but their data is not available on line and could needed to be requested. We will send a request to see if the if this data can be released.  The lack of identification prevented from finding other infomation from nzdigital and the national library but in the future this could be made accessable.

The project source code repo is available at  https://github.com/tairea/GovHack2016-Monumental
